"""
This program calculates the final balance using **compound interest**.

The user is asked to enter:
- the principal amount (initial money),
- the annual interest rate (in percent),
- and the time period in years.

The program validates each input to ensure it's not negative or zero 
(where not allowed). Then, it uses the compound interest formula:

    A = P * (1 + r/100) ^ t

Where:
- A is the final amount,
- P is the principal,
- r is the interest rate,
- t is the time in years.

The result is displayed with two decimal places.



principle = 0
rate = 0
time = 0

while True:
    principle = float(input("Enter the principle amount: "))
    if principle < 0:
        print("Principle can not be less than zero. ")
    else:
        break
while True:
    rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate: "))
    if rate < 0:
        print("Interest rate can not be less than zero. ")
    else:
        break
while True:
    time = int(input("Enter the time in years: "))
    if time <= 0:
        print("Time can not be less than zero. ")
    else:
        break

total = principle * pow((1 + rate / 100), time)
print(f"Balance after {time} year/s is ${total:.2f}: ")
